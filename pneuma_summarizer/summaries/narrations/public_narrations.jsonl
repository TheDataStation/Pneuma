{"table": "table_171", "summary": "tPP6TRP: A long list of columns!\n\nAfter reviewing the column names, I was able to identify `tPP6TRP` as a column that likely represents \"Post Position 6 Trip\" in a horse racing context. In horse racing, the post position refers to the starting position of a horse in a race, and the trip refers to the horse's performance in that race. Therefore, `tPP6TRP` likely represents the performance of a horse in the 6th post position in a particular race."}
{"table": "table_171", "summary": "tPP7TRK: A long list of columns!\n\nAfter reviewing the column names, I was able to identify `tPP7TRK` as a column that likely represents \"Track 7 Performance Points\" or \"Track 7 Results\" in a racing or horse racing context. The \"PP\" prefix suggests that it's related to performance points or ratings, and the \"7\" likely indicates the specific track or event being referenced. However, without more context or information about the table's purpose, this is just an educated guess."}
{"table": "table_171", "summary": "tPP7TRP: A long list of columns!\n\nAfter reviewing the column names, I was able to identify `tPP7TRP` as a column that likely represents \"Trainer's 7th Trip Result\" or \"Trainer's 7th Trip Performance\".
